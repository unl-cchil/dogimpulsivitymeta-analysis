## Risk of Bias
To quantify risk of bias for the studies included in our review, we used the Risk of Bias Utilized for Surveys Tool (ROBUST) from @Nudelman.Otto.2020. We applied this tool to all 17 analyzed studies (Table 1). Here we describe the eight categories of bias along with justifications for our categorizations, including an overal assessment of risk of bias. We then illustrate the study-level categorizations (Figure \ref{fig:rob-traffic}) and a summary over all studies (Figure \ref{fig:rob-summary}).


### Sampling frame

Sample frame references the correspondence between the theoretical population and the sampled population. It captures the representativeness or generalizability of the sample to the population of interest (in our case all pet dogs). Therefore, we indicate higher bias scores for less representative samples such as only younger dogs [@Brady.etal.2018 Study 3], dogs raised in outdoor packs [@Marshall-Pescini.etal.2015; @Brucks.etal.2019], dogs living in a shelter [@Fagnani.etal.2016a Study 2; @Fagnani.etal.2016], restricted numbers of breeds [@Muller.etal.2016; @Kelly.etal.2019], or combining mixed populations of dogs [@Fagnani.etal.2016; @Olsen.2019 Study 2].

### Participant recruitment

Participant recruitment simply refers to whether the authors described how recruitment occurred. Studies without a description received lower scores.

### Acceptability of exclusion rate

Exclusions are relatively common in canine behavioral science. However, we scored studies at higher risk of bias if they had  large exclusion rates [>33%, @Fagnani.etal.2016a Study 1; @Muller.etal.2016] or if exclusions were post-hoc with direct impacts on results [@Brady.etal.2018 Study 1; see @Stevens.etal.2022a for impact].

### Sufficiency of sample size

Sample sizes varied from 13-67 subjects across the studies (Table 1). Though admittedly arbitrary, we considered sample sizes less than 25 as high risk, between 25-50 as medium risk, and greater than 50 as low risk. Unfortunately, most studies fall under high risk of bias given their small sample sizes (Figure \ref{fig:samplesize}).

### Demographic variables

Reporting demographic variables is critical for contextualizing results and comparing across populations. Though all studies reported the sex ratio of their sample, several did not report the neuter status, resulting in less information on subjects and potentially higher risk of bias.

### Reliability of measurements

Most studies reported here used existing task designs with reliable measures of impulsivity. However, @Mongillo.etal.2019 used a novel design with a more complicated measure than was warranted for studies of spatial impulsivity.

### Setting

Experimental setting is critical to animal cognition studies to maintain consistency across subjects. Though most studies tested subjects in the same location, some studies tested subjects at the owner's home [@Brady.etal.2018 Study 2; @Olsen.2019], resulting in less consistency in experience and potentially higher risk of bias.

### Data management

There were no concerns about how authors addressed missing data, outliers, or invalid responses.

### Overall

We weighted sufficiency of sample size, exclusion rate, and setting as the most important criteria for risk of bias. Studies with low bias in sample size or medium bias in sample size and medium bias in up to one other criterion were categorized as low overall risk of bias. Studies with high risk in sample size and medium risk in either exclusion rate or setting were categorized as high overall risk of bias. All other studies were categorized as medium risk.
